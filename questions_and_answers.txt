Question: Ohm�s Law relates voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) as:
A  I = V � R 
B  V = I � R 
C  R = V � I 
D  V = I � R 
correct answer B: V = I � R
Question: Hooke�s Law for a linear spring states that the force F is proportional to displacement x:
A   F = k � x 
B  F = k � x� 
C  F = k � x 
D   F = x � k 
correct answer A:  F = k � x

A  Force equals mass times acceleration 
B  Energy cannot be created or destroyed. 
C  A body at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by a force. 
D  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. 
correct answer A: Force equals mass times acceleration
