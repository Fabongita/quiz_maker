Question: Ohm’s Law relates voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) as:
A   V = I × R 
B   R = V × I 
C   I = V × R 
D  V = I ÷ R 
correct answer A:  V = I × R
Question: Hooke’s Law for a linear spring states that the force F is proportional to displacement x:
A   F = x ÷ k 
B  F = k × x² 
C  F = k × x 
D   F = k ÷ x 
correct answer C: F = k × x
Question: Newton's Second law of Motion is:
A  Energy cannot be created or destroyed. 
B   Force equals mass times acceleration. 
C  A body at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by a force. 
D  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. 
correct answer B:  Force equals mass times acceleration.
